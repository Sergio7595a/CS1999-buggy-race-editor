# important:
#-------------------------------------------------------------
# This script initialises your SQLite database for you, just
# to get you started... there are better ways to express the
# data you're going to need... especially outside SQLite.
# For example... maybe flag_pattern should be an ENUM (which
# is available in most other SQL databases), or a foreign key
# to a pattern table?
#
# Also... the name of the database (here, in SQLite, it's a
# filename) appears in more than one place in the project.
# That doesn't feel right, does it?
#-------------------------------------------------------------

# using Python's triple-quote for multi-line strings:

connection.execute("ALTER TABLE buggies ADD COLUMN power_type VARCHAR(20);")

print("- OK, your database is ready")

connection.close()
