      I forked the repo on GitHub Desktop
    </p>
    <p>
      Once the repo was on my own machine,
      i was able to edit it and proceed to make more changes without worry,
      because i could revert the changes. after each session i did a push.
      Each time i pulled the data to the uni's systems and doing the same there.
